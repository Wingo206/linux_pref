NERDTree tips:
- Opens automatically when opening vim
- TT set to toggle NERDTree
- Use J and K to move down and up
- Use / to find text within vim. Can be used within NERDTree
- <space> set to unfold directories and open files in new tab
- Closes when it is the last remaining window
- use <Ctrl> ww to toggle between active windows. Can be used to focus on NERDTree
